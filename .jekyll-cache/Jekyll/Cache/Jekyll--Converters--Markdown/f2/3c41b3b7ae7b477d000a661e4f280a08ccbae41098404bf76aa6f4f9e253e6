GPU workloads as a case study.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="users-and-contributors-gathering">Users and Contributors gathering</h3>

<p>KubeVirt users and contributors will get together to talk about KubeVirt,
brainstorm ideas to help us shape the projectâ€™s next steps, and generally get
some face to face time.</p>

<p>If you are already using or contributing to KubeVirt, you are considering to try
it, or just want to present your use case and discuss KubeVirtâ€™s fit or needs
weâ€™d be very glad to meet you there.</p>

<p>Red Hat is sponsoring a venue for the meetup right next to the conferenceâ€™s
venue. Space is limited, so we are asking people to <a href="https://kubevirt-kubecon19na.eventbrite.com">register in
advance</a>.</p>

<p>KubeVirt will also be featured in a couple of demos at the Red Hat booth in
the exposition hall. You can find the demo schedule at their <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/events/red-hat-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019">event landing page</a>.</p>
