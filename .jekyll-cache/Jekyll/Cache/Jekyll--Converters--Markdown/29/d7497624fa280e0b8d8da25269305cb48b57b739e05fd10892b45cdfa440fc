I"H<p>In this set of affinity rules, a new scheduling policy has been introduced: <code class="highlighter-rouge">preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution</code>. It can be thought as “soft” scheduling, in the sense that it specifies preferences that the scheduler will try to enforce but will not guarantee.</p>

<p>The weight field in preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution must be in the range 1-100 and it is taken into account in the <a href="#introduction">scoring step</a>. Remember that the node(s) with the highest total score is/are the most preferred.</p>
