<p>Working with websites and with this KubeVirt website for a while has given the idea of things that should improve it.</p>

<p>As this is a community-driven effort, what could better do rather than ask YOU for feedback?</p>

<p>We’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt.github.io/blob/source/TODO.md">TODO.md</a> file to track what we’ve identified.</p>

<p>Additionally, as that file is part of the repository, it can be PR’d, commented via the PR’s to it, etc.</p>

<p>Please, let us know what do you think about what is proposed, or propose new ideas to be added (or create <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt.github.io/issues/new">new issues</a> to have them added)</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of KubeVirt community!</p>
