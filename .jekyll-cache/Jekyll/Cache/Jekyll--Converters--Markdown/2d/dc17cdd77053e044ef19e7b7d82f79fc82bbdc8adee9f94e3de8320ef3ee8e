I"*<p>Some time ago, with the PR <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/265">https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/265</a>, KubeVirt was proposed to be part of the CNCF Sandbox.</p>

<p>On 9th September 2019, the project has finally accomplished the required steps to get in (including two sponsors) to get listed as part of it at <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/</a></p>

<p>The document with the proposal can be read at the final repo at <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/sandbox/kubevirt.adoc">https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/sandbox/kubevirt.adoc</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s interesting to see the messages of support at the PR that show interesting use cases by our users, so keep an eye on them!</p>
