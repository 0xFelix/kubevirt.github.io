I"m<p>Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">eth0</code> has no IP address and <code class="highlighter-rouge">br1</code> is in the self-assigned range the pod has no network access. There are also no routes in the pod. This can be resolved for troubleshooting by creating a veth pair, adding one of the interfaces to the bridge and assigning an IP address in the pod subnet for the host. Routes are also required to be added. This is performed for running skydive in the pod see <a href="https://github.com/jcpowermac/kubevirt-network-deepdive/blob/master/kubernetes/skydive/skydive.sh">skydive.sh</a> for more details.</p>
