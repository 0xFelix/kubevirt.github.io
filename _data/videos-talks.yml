  # - title: Fabian Deutsch - Outcast - Virtualization in a container world?
  #   intro: Containers seem to be like virtualization, just better. Is it just a matter of time until all VMs will have vanished, and their workloads live their life in containers? Well - This depends on the problem you try to solve. This talk is about looking at why virtualization is still needed in a container world and where it is found.

  # - title: Friendly coexistence of Virtual Machines and Containers on Kubernetes using KubeVirt
  #   intro: KubeVirt is intended to provide a convergence point for the data center of the future using Kubernetes as an infrastructure fabric for both application container and virtual machine workloads. Using a unified management approach simplifies deployments, allows for better resource utilization, and supports different workloads in a more optimal way.
